<h1 id="nyc-yellow-cab-taxi-data-analysis-project-proposal">NYC Yellow Cab Taxi Data Analysis Project Proposal</h1>
<h2 id="dataset-context-and-overview">Dataset Context and Overview</h2>
<p>The New York City Yellow Cab taxi dataset for January 2024 contains comprehensive information about 2,964,624 individual taxi trips, representing one of the largest and most dynamic transportation datasets available for urban mobility analysis. This dataset captures the pulse of New York City's transportation ecosystem during the winter month of January, providing insights into travel patterns, fare structures, and operational dynamics of the iconic yellow cab industry.</p>
<p>The dataset includes 19 variables covering temporal, geographic, financial, and operational dimensions of each trip. Key variables include pickup and dropoff timestamps, passenger counts, trip distances, fare amounts, tip amounts, payment methods, vendor information, and location identifiers. The data spans from December 31, 2002, to February 1, 2024, with the majority of trips occurring in January 2024, suggesting some data quality issues that will require careful preprocessing.</p>
<h2 id="initial-data-investigation">Initial Data Investigation</h2>
<p>Our preliminary analysis reveals several important characteristics of the dataset:</p>
<p><strong>Scale and Coverage</strong>: The dataset contains nearly 3 million trips with an average of 84,704 trips per day, peaking at 110,515 trips on January 27, 2024. The busiest hour is 6:00 PM with 212,788 trips, while the quietest hour is 4:00 AM with 16,742 trips, reflecting typical urban commuting patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Structure</strong>: Fare amounts range from -$899 to $5,000, with a mean of $18.18 and median of $12.80. Approximately 37,448 trips have negative fares (likely data errors), and 893 trips have zero fares. Tips are provided in 76% of trips, with a mean tip amount of $3.34 and median of $2.70. The total amount per trip averages $26.80.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Patterns</strong>: Three vendors operate the fleet, with Vendor 2 handling 75.4% of trips and Vendor 1 handling 24.6%. Payment methods show 78.2% using Type 1 (likely credit card), 14.8% using Type 2 (likely cash), and 4.7% using Type 0 (likely no charge). Rate Code 1 (standard fare) represents 89.8% of trips.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Distribution</strong>: The dataset uses location IDs (1-265) rather than coordinates, with 260 unique pickup locations and 261 unique dropoff locations, covering the entire NYC metropolitan area.</p>
<p><strong>Data Quality Issues</strong>: Approximately 4.73% of records have missing values in passenger_count, RatecodeID, store_and_fwd_flag, congestion_surcharge, and Airport_fee fields. Additionally, there are data anomalies including negative trip durations and extreme fare amounts that require investigation.</p>
<h2 id="research-objectives-and-hypotheses">Research Objectives and Hypotheses</h2>
<h3 id="primary-research-objective">Primary Research Objective</h3>
<p>To analyze the relationship between temporal patterns, trip characteristics, and fare determinants in NYC Yellow Cab taxi operations during January 2024, with particular focus on understanding demand patterns, pricing dynamics, and operational efficiency factors.</p>
<h3 id="secondary-objectives">Secondary Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Identify peak demand periods and their relationship to fare amounts and tip behavior</li>
<li>Analyze the impact of trip distance and duration on fare structure and customer satisfaction (measured through tips)</li>
<li>Examine vendor performance differences and their correlation with customer payment preferences</li>
<li>Investigate geographic patterns in trip demand and fare variations across different NYC locations</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="research-hypotheses">Research Hypotheses</h3>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1: Temporal Demand and Pricing Relationship</strong>
H1: Peak demand hours (6-8 PM) will show significantly higher average fares compared to off-peak hours, controlling for distance and duration.
H1₀: There is no significant difference in average fares between peak and off-peak hours.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 2: Trip Distance and Fare Elasticity</strong>
H2: There is a positive correlation between trip distance and fare amount, but the relationship will be non-linear due to base fare structures and congestion pricing.
H2₀: Trip distance and fare amount are not significantly correlated.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 3: Customer Satisfaction and Tip Behavior</strong>
H3: Longer trip durations (controlling for distance) will be associated with lower tip percentages, suggesting customer dissatisfaction with traffic delays.
H3₀: Trip duration is not significantly associated with tip percentage.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 4: Vendor Performance and Customer Preferences</strong>
H4: Different vendors will show significant differences in average tip percentages and customer payment method preferences, indicating varying service quality levels.
H4₀: There are no significant differences in tip percentages or payment preferences across vendors.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 5: Geographic Fare Variation</strong>
H5: Certain pickup/dropoff location combinations will show significantly different fare structures, reflecting market demand and operational complexity variations across NYC neighborhoods.
H5₀: Geographic location does not significantly affect fare amounts.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-and-statistical-approach">Methodology and Statistical Approach</h2>
<p>The analysis will employ multiple statistical techniques including:
- Descriptive statistics and data visualization for exploratory analysis
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables
- Regression analysis to model fare determinants and tip behavior
- ANOVA/t-test comparisons for vendor and temporal differences
- Geographic analysis using location-based clustering techniques</p>
<p>Data preprocessing will focus on cleaning anomalies, handling missing values, and creating derived variables such as trip duration, fare per mile, and tip percentage. The analysis will control for confounding variables and use appropriate statistical tests to validate the hypotheses.</p>
<p>This comprehensive analysis will provide valuable insights into NYC's transportation ecosystem and contribute to understanding urban mobility patterns, customer behavior, and operational efficiency in the taxi industry.</p>
